Tutorial Future Commits.

Computational assumptions:
- you already have singularity and virtualenv available on your system
- you are using a computational cluster that can submit ~100 jobs simultaneously. They don't have to all run at the same time but can at least be scheduled at once.
- Access to at least one node with >100Gb of ram that you can use for >150h runtime. This is needed for EarlGrey and Braker

LiftOff reference file:
	- If LiftOff reference is a gff made from mikado, convert "ncRNA_gene" to "gene" so that lncRNA lift over
	- R script to exctract ncRNA models from liftOff

Final annotation:
	- Add biotype column & convert "type" to the NCBI/ENSEMBL format?
	- TCR/IGG genes
	- lncRNA gene symbols

Communication:
  - IGV examples and mammalian regions to check

ISO-seq:
	- workflow for when --mixed, --long, and --short are all viable data options

Pipeline flexibility
- replace cactus binary + venv with singularity

Future directions:
	- multiple reference species
	- add custom gtf & reference mode option
